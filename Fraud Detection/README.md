Scenario
========

For this project you will attach a regular USB camera to your Windows IoT Core device along with a PIR sensor (theÂ required hardware will have been supplied to you by your instructor).
This basic system will detect movement near the camera and trigger it to take a photograph. The image will be uploaded to Azure where Cortana Analytics will analyse the photo.
 __TODO: What will it do with it?__

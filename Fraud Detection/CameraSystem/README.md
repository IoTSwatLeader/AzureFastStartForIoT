#Security System

With this project you can take photos using a supported camera and have them uploaded to the cloud.

This project support several configurations:
  1. The base configuration uses a USB camera and PIR motion sensor.
  2. Alternatively, a D-Link IP camera can be used for both sensing motion and taking pictures.
  3. Photos are stored locally on the device but can be uploaded in OneDrive or Azure blob storage
  4. A website can be deployed to Azure to view the photos.

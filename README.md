# Azure Fast Start for IoT

Welcome to the *Azure Fast Start for IoT*, a series of scenarios designed to help you build basic projects that integrate hardware running on Windows 10 Core with the IoT features of Microsoft Azure.

The content has been drawn from a number of different locations and authors and is indended to be used during the delivery of an *Azure Fast Start for IoT*, a 4 day delivery by Microsoft Premier Services to help customers build working prototypes based on IoT devices and using Azure services for data processing.

The three scenarios currently available are:

Fraud Prevention
----------------

Build a system which uses the camera attached to your Windows 10 Core device to scan the face of a person entering a building and automatically open the door for a recognised employee. This scenario will leverage Windows 10 IoT, Azure Storage Accounts and Machine Learning with Cortana for data processing.

This scenario is made up from two separate projects from [Hackster.io](http://www.hackster.io):-

* [Security Camera](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/windows-iot/security-camera-579b7f).
* [Face Detection in Windows 10 IoT core with Oxford Project](https://www.hackster.io/dx-lego-china/face-detection-in-windows-10-iot-core-with-oxford-project-509a3b).

Credits for these projects are as follows:-

* [Security Camera](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/windows-iot/security-camera-579b7f) - Made by Windows IoT team ([Matt McKee](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/mwmckee), [Aparajita Dutta](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/apdutta), [Windows IoT](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/windowsiot), [Jon Gallant](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/jongallant), [Masato Sudo](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/mazudo), [Shawn Foltz](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/ShawnFoltz)).

Predictive Maintenance
----------------------

### Find the content for this scenario at [Predictive Maintenance](/Predictive Maintenance).

Build a system which uses an external sensor to detect oil levels in a pieces of machinery and relays the information to Azure. The collected data will be used to proactively detect impending maintenance issues and send control signals back to the device. This scenario will build on the Predictive Maintenance scenario which is part of the [Azure IoT Suite](http://wwww.azureiotsuite.com).

This scenario is based on a project from [Hackster.io](http://www.hackster.io):-

* [Oil Level Monitoring](https://www.hackster.io/sameerk/oil-level-monitoring-ac01b9).
* Additional content has been added by [Microsoft Premier Services](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftservices/support.aspx).

Connected Campus
----------------

### Find the content for this scenario at [Connected Campus](/Connected Campus)

This project uses Windows IoT Core and Azure to send data to iOS, Android and Windows 10 Universal Windows Platform Apps to inform users whether a room is free and its current environmental conditions such as temperature etc.

This scenario is based on a project from [Hackster.io](http://www.hackster.io):-

* [Intelligent Multi-Conference Room using UWP App and Azure](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/Kishore10211/intelligent-multi-conference-room-using-uwp-app-and-azure-620b1d).
* Additional content has been added by [Microsoft Premier Services](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftservices/support.aspx).

Retail Management System and Inventory Optimization
---------------------------------------------------

### Find the content for this scenario at [Management System and Inventory](/Management System and Inventory)

This scenario uses Windows IoT Core to send information about RFID tagged items to IoT Suite. __What will you do with it then?__

This scenario is based on a project from [Hackster.io](http://www.hackster.io):-

* [long-range-uhf-rfid-item-tracking](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/careypayette/long-range-uhf-rfid-item-tracking-system-fc5372)

# Azure Fast Start for IoT

Welcome to the *Azure Fast Start for IoT*, a series of practical labs and scenarios designed to help you build basic projects that integrate hardware running on Windows 10 Core with the IoT features of Microsoft Azure.

The content has been drawn from a number of different locations and authors and is indended to be used during the delivery of an *Azure Fast Start for IoT*, a 4 day delivery by Microsoft Premier Services to help customers build working prototypes based on IoT devices and using Azure services for data processing.

A full [kit list of the hardware needed to build these scenarios](Electronics/Kit List.md) is available.

The scenarios currently available are:

Fraud Detection
---------------

### Find the content for this scenario at [Fraud Detection](/Fraud Detection)

For this scenario you will imagine that you are building a system that uses a photograph of a person to determine if they should be admitted to a building.
This could form part of a two phase security check, e.g. Do you have the correct access badge and the face that matches it?

This scenario is made up from two separate projects from [Hackster.io](http://www.hackster.io):-

* [Security Camera](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/windows-iot/security-camera-579b7f).
* [Face Detection in Windows 10 IoT core with Oxford Project](https://www.hackster.io/dx-lego-china/face-detection-in-windows-10-iot-core-with-oxford-project-509a3b).

Credits for these projects are as follows:-

* [Security Camera](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/windows-iot/security-camera-579b7f) - Made by Windows IoT team ([Matt McKee](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/mwmckee), [Aparajita Dutta](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/apdutta), [Windows IoT](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/windowsiot), [Jon Gallant](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/jongallant), [Masato Sudo](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/mazudo), [Shawn Foltz](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/ShawnFoltz)).
* [Face Detection in Windows 10 IoT core with Oxford Project](https://www.hackster.io/dx-lego-china/face-detection-in-windows-10-iot-core-with-oxford-project-509a3b) - Made by Team DX LEGO CHINA [Zepeng She](https://www.hackster.io/cheneyszp).


Predictive Maintenance
----------------------

### Find the content for this scenario at [Predictive Maintenance](/Predictive Maintenance).

Build a system which uses an external sensor to detect oil levels in a pieces of machinery and relays the information to Azure. The collected data will be used to proactively detect impending maintenance issues and send control signals back to the device. This scenario will build on the Predictive Maintenance scenario which is part of the [Azure IoT Suite](http://wwww.azureiotsuite.com).

Connected Campus
----------------

### Find the content for this scenario at [Connected Campus](/Connected Campus)

This project uses Windows IoT Core and Azure to send data to iOS, Android and Windows 10 Universal Windows Platform Apps to inform users whether a room is free and its current environmental conditions such as temperature etc.

This scenario is based on a project from [Hackster.io](http://www.hackster.io):-

* [Intelligent Multi-Conference Room using UWP App and Azure](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/Kishore10211/intelligent-multi-conference-room-using-uwp-app-and-azure-620b1d).
* Additional content has been added by [Microsoft Premier Services](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftservices/support.aspx).

Retail Management System and Inventory Optimization
---------------------------------------------------

### Find the content for this scenario at [Management System and Inventory](/Management System and Inventory)

This scenario uses Windows IoT Core to send information about RFID tagged items to IoT Suite. __What will you do with it then?__

This scenario is based on a project from [Hackster.io](http://www.hackster.io):-

* [long-range-uhf-rfid-item-tracking](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/careypayette/long-range-uhf-rfid-item-tracking-system-fc5372)

Remote Patient Monitoring and Clinical Analytics
------------------------------------------------

### Find the content for this scenario at [Remote Patient Monitoring and Clinical Analytics](/Patient Monitoring)

This scenario will use Windows IoT, Azure storage, data processing and Cortana Analytics for intelligent interactions with the user. 

This scenario is based on a project from [Hackster.io](http://www.hackster.io):-

* [Building a Electrocardiogram with Windows IOT and Azure](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/phantom_override/building-a-electrocardiogram-with-windows-iot-and-azure-8b2b44?ref=channel&ref_id=4087_popular___&offset=270)

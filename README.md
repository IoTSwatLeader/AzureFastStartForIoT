# Azure Fast Start for IoT

Welcome to the *Azure Fast Start for IoT*, a series of scenarios designed to help you build basic projects that integrate hardware running on Windows 10 Core with the IoT features of Microsoft Azure.

The content has been drawn from a number of different locations and authors and is indended to be used during the delivery of an *Azure Fast Start for IoT*, a 4 day delivery by Microsoft Premier Services to help customers build working prototypes based on IoT devices and using Azure services for data processing.

The three scenarios currently available are:

Fraud Prevention
----------------

Build a system which uses the camera attached to your Windows 10 Core device to scan the face of a person entering a building and automatically open the door for a recognised employee. This scenario will leverage Windows 10 IoT, Azure for storage and Machine Learning for data processing.
